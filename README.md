The brain is one of the most complicated and important part of the human body,
 but still there’re many things we don’t know yet about.
In our project we work with brain signals that called LFP, which is low frequency signal – between 0 to 150 hz.
Our main goal is to classify the brain signals into the areas they came from.

Over the years, researchers found out that there is a similarity between the human brain to the monkey brain. 
Because we can’t preform experiments on humans we used brain signals from
3 monkeys – carmen, menta and penny, that where collected in a laboratory in EIN CAREM

The question we addressed in this project  is can we use neural signals recorded from the brain
to specifically identify the recoding sites?
In other words, what is the mapping between the structural and functional organization of the brain.
